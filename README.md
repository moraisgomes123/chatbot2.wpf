# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot – Part 2

An advanced modular cybersecurity chatbot built with **C#**, **WPF**, and **.NET** that educates users on cybersecurity awareness through an intelligent and interactive graphical interface.

This enhanced version expands on Part 1 by introducing:

- Intent recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Memory management
- Context-aware follow-up handling
- Randomized response generation
- Fallback response mechanisms
- WPF graphical user interface

The chatbot is designed using modern software engineering principles including modular programming, separation of concerns, SOLID principles, and layered architecture.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a modular layered architecture to ensure:

- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Reusability
- Separation of concerns
- Clean code organization


# 📂 Folder Responsibilities

| Folder | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Chatbot/** | Core chatbot logic, context tracking, sentiment analysis, memory handling, UI formatting |
| **Services/** | Business logic services including intent recognition, keyword matching, fallback handling, and response generation |
| **Models/** | Data models used throughout the application |
| **Utilities/** | Validation and helper functionality |
| **Data/** | JSON-based knowledge base |
| **Audio/** | WAV audio greeting resources |



# 🚀 Features

# 🧠 Intelligent Intent Recognition

The chatbot can identify the user's intent using the `IntentClassifier` service.

## Supported Intent Types

- Greeting
- Password Safety
- Phishing Awareness
- Malware Awareness
- Cybersecurity Help
- Exit Commands

The intent recognition system improves conversational accuracy and creates more meaningful interactions.



# 😊 Sentiment Analysis

The chatbot analyzes the user's emotional tone using the `SentimentAnalyzer`.

## Supported Sentiments

- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative
- Frustrated

The chatbot adapts responses based on detected sentiment to create a more natural conversational experience.



# 💾 Memory Management

The `MemoryManager` stores conversation history and previously discussed topics.

## Benefits

- Maintains conversation continuity
- Supports contextual understanding
- Improves follow-up interactions
- Simulates human-like memory



# 🔄 Context-Aware Follow-Up Handling

The chatbot can understand follow-up questions based on previous conversation context.

## Example

User: What is phishing?
Bot: Explains phishing attack

User: How can I avoid it?
Bot: Understands "it" refers to phishing


This functionality is managed using:

- `ConversationContext.cs`
- `FollowUpHandler.cs`


# 🎲 Randomized Responses

The `RandomResponseService` generates varied responses to avoid repetitive conversations.


# 🛡️ Fallback Response System

If the chatbot cannot identify the user's intent or keywords, the `FallbackService` generates safe fallback responses.

## Example

```text
"I'm not sure I understand that yet, but I can help with cybersecurity topics like phishing, passwords, malware, and safe browsing."
```

# 🔐 Cybersecurity Topics Covered

The chatbot provides educational information about:

- Phishing
- Malware
- Password Security
- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Social Engineering
- Safe Browsing
- Email Security
- Online Privacy
- Cyber Hygiene
- Ransomware
- Cyber Threat Awareness

# 🖥️ WPF Graphical User Interface

Part 2 introduces a complete WPF graphical interface replacing the console-only interface from Part 1.


# 🎨 GUI Features

- Modern graphical chat interface
- User-friendly interaction
- Styled message display
- Responsive layout using XAML
- Event-driven programming architecture
- Improved user experience
